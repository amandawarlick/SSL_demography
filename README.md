## Abstract

1. We fit mark-resight data to a Bayesian multi-event model to examine mechanisms linking environmental conditions to population dynamics and inform conservation measures for an endangered top predator: Steller sea lions. 
2. The first demographic rates estimated for the western portion of the wDPS Steller sea lion range where abundance continues to decline indicate low male pup and female juvenile survival. 
3. Pup survival was positively correlated with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation during the study period. 
4. This work can advance efforts to identify factors driving regionally divergent abundance trends, with implications for population-level responses to future climate variability.
